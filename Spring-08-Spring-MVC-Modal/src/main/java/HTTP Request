      and the server validates these credentials


      1==> An HTTP request parameter : represents a simple way to send values from client to server in a key- value format.
             they are also called query parameter
     2==>A path variable : sending data through the request path itself
     3==> An HTTP request header : similarly to the request parameters the request headers are sent through the HTTP header.
     4==> The HTTP request body
