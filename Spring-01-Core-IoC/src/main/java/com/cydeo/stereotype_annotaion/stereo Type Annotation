When the app creates the Spring context, Spring creates an instance of the
class you marked as a component and adds that instance to its context.
We still have a configuration class when we use this approach to tell Spring
where to look for the classes annotated with stereotype annotations.

Stereotype annotations can not be used for classes that you can not change.


Summary

Spring context is a bucket in which you add the instances you expect Spring to be able to manage.
Spring can see only the instances you added to its context.
You can add instances into context using the @Bean annotation or using stereotype annotations.
Using the @Bean annotation to add instances to the Spring context enables you to add any kind
of object instance as a bean and even multiple instances of the same kind to the Spring context.
Using stereotype annotations, you can create beans only for your application classes that you  annotate with a specific annotation (like @Component)
