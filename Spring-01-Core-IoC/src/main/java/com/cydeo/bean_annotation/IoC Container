IoC Container : Defining beans
You are working for a Consulting Company as a Developer
Your company just received a project from Cydeo
Cydeo wants you to create an application that will create an account for
their full time and part time mentors
Client wants to switch between accounts easily in the same functionality


IoC is a principle that we do not leave the app control the execution by its own code
and use dependencies. Instead, we allow the framework to control the app and its
code.

Advantages :
Decoupling the execution of a task from its implementation
Making it easier to switch between different implementation
Great ease in testing a program by isolating a component or mocking it
dependencies



There are multiple ways to add beans in the Spring context
Using the @Bean annotation
Using stereotype annotations


**********Adding new beans to the spring context
There are multiple ways to add beans in the Spring context
==>Using the @Bean annotation
      Define a configuration class (annotated with @Configuration).  Add to the configuration class a method that returns the object instance
         that you want to add to the context and annotate the method with the @Bean annotation.
     Make Spring use the configuration class defined in the first step.


==>Using stereotype annotations
Using the @Component annotation, mark the classes for which you want Spring to add an instance into its context.
Using @ComponentScan annotation over the configuration class, instruct Spring where to find the classes you marked for being managed by the framework.
