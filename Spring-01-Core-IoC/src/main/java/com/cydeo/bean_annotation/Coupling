     Coupling :
Usage of an object by another object.
It simply means that one object requires another object to complete its assigned task.
There are two types of coupling :


    Tight Coupling:
A group of classes are highly dependent on one another.
A class has a direct reference to a concrete class.


    Loose Coupling :
An object gets the object to be used from external sources.
Reduces the dependencies of a class that uses the different classes directly.


       SPRING CORE:
Spring core is the part of the Spring framework providing the foundational mechanism used by Spring to integrate


     IoC(Inversion of Control)
IoC is a principle that we do not leave the app control the execution by its own code and use dependencies.
Instead, we allow the framework to control the app and its code.

     Advantages :
Decoupling the execution of a task from its implementation
Making it easier to switch between different implementation
Great ease in testing a program by isolating a component or mocking it
