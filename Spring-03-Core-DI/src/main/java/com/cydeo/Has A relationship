Implementing Relationship among beans defined in the Configuration File

There are 2 ways in which we can establish the relationship among beans:
Wiring : This is the approach where the relationship is implemented by directly calling
           @Bean annotated method from the other @Bean annotated method that defines the second bean of the relationship.
Autowiring : This is the approach where we let Spring provide a value for a parameter we define for the @Bean annotated method.



**********Dependency Injection
Dependency Injection is a fundamental aspect of the Spring framework, through which the Spring container "injects" objects into other objects or “dependencies”.
DI is an application of the IoC principle. The IoC principle implied that the framework controls the application at execution.



Using the @Autowired annotation, we mark an object’s property where we want Spring to
      inject a value from the context. And we mark this intention directly in the class that defines the object which needs the dependency.
There are 3 ways in which we can use the @Autowired annotation:

Injecting the value in the field of the class
Injecting the value through the constructor for the class
Injecting the value through setter
